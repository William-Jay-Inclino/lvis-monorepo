1. Install OpenSSH Server

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server


2. Start and Enable SSH Service

sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh


3. Verify SSH Service is Running
sudo systemctl status ssh



If everything is set up correctly, you should see something like this:

‚óè ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since <date>


4. Check Firewall Settings
Ensure that your firewall allows incoming SSH connections on port 22. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian with ufw:

sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable


5. Test SSH Connection
Once the SSH server is running and the firewall is properly configured, try to SSH into your server again:

ssh kriz@192.168.1.110
