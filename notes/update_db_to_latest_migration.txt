Check Your Local Migrations Directory
Go to your project's prisma/migrations directory, and look for the name of the last migration folder. It will look something like this:


prisma/migrations/
    ├── 20230601_initial_migration
    ├── 20230615_add_contact_person


In this example, the latest migration is 20230615_add_contact_person.


Mark the Latest Local Migration as Applied Run the following command, using your local migration name:


npx prisma migrate resolve --applied "20230615_add_contact_person"

This tells Prisma, "Consider this migration as applied, even if the _prisma_migrations table doesn't show it."


After resolving the migration, follow up with:
npx prisma db push



This will ensure the schema is updated in your local database without creating or applying new migrations.
